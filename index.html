            <h1>Hello, I'm Amrin</h1>
            <p>
              I’m a Mathematics and Environmental Geoscience major with a Data Science minor (Class of 2027),
              drawn to the hidden systems beneath everyday life — like Chihiro learning the rules of a mysterious world, or Arrietty navigating vast spaces with care and precision.
              I explore problems like a Borrower with a spool of thread — resourceful, curious, and grounded in detail. 
              From modeling ecosystems to analyzing market patterns, I bring a sense of wonder and focus to the unseen structures that shape our world.
              My work blends math, science, and economics — always looking for the quiet insights tucked between data points, and the magic in solving real-world problems with clarity and care.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Research Assistant – Perturbation Theory</strong><br>
          Applied numerical analysis methods including Runge-Kutta and Taylor series expansions to solve complex partial differential equations. 
          Focused on modeling BZ (Belousov-Zhabotinsky) wave phenomena to understand nonlinear system behavior and pattern formation. Conducted simulations in Python and Mathematica to explore stability, sensitivity, and dynamic transitions. 🍃</li>
          <li><strong>Phage Therapy Research</strong><br>
          Explored the invisible battle between viruses and bacteria by building ODE models in Python. Simulated healing dynamics and translated complexity into clean, story-like reports using LaTeX. 🦠 </li>
          <li><strong>Finance Intern – AMRE</strong><br>
          Mapped the hidden currents of a nonprofit’s inventory system, finding gaps and improving how things flowed. Translated insights into stories and solutions — shared with the people who make mission-driven work happen. 🌊</li>
         <li><strong>Math Tutor & TA</strong><br>
          Guided students through the forest of formulas — from the curves of calculus to the logic of ledgers. Helped them see the patterns, connect the pieces, and grow into thinkers who feel at home with numbers.🍁 </li>
